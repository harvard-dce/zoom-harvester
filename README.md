## Terms

**Meeting ids: meeting_uuid, series_id**

To Zoom, meeting means both an individual instance of a meeting and a series of meetings. There are unique ids for each meeting instance, and series ids that can remain static for a series of reoccuring meetings. The Zoom API docmentation refers to both types of ids as "meeting id". We will to the id for an individual meeting as _meeting_uuid_, and the id for a series as _series_id_.

**Meeting types: live vs past**

When calling /metrics/meetings, you must specify meeting type: live or past. Live meetings are meetings that are currently happening and do not have an end time or duration yet. All live meetings become past meetings so meetings.py only searches for past meetings.

_**More notes on meetings:**_

Within the series_id, there can be several types:
- Most Common:
    * 9-digit ids tied to a repeating or scheduled series of meeting, such as a class that meets every Wednesday.
- Less Common:
    * 10-digit ids for PMIs (Personal Meeting Rooms) is a series id that an individual user can associate with their account so that every meeting that they host can be accessed with the same link in the format https://zoom.us/j/0123456789
    * 9-digit meeting ids not associated with a series of meetings or a PMI, these are instant meetings which will show up when you search for all the meetings over a period of time (/metrics/meetings/) but will not show up if you try to look them up individual (/meetings/get/)


**user_id**

Since only hosts have accounts, most of the time user_id refers to a host. Participants are not required to have accounts and do not log in when they join a meeting but are generated temporary non-unique "user_ids."


**Sessions / participant sessions**

Each individual instance of a meeting participant entering and exiting a meeting. Can occur many times during the same meeting if, for example, the participant has a bad connection. Number of sessions for a given meeting does not equal the number of participants.
